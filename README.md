# Betting Simulation

practicing OOP and multithreading in c++ on a custom made problem

### Problem statement

We will simulate a betting excercise, similiar to the dog races.
There are 100 players with 100 dollars betting on 5 dogs. The Betting company makes the bets, such that whatever the outcome is, it is winning money.

The betting will cosist of n rounds

1. The betting company discloses the quotes for every dog, and the player pay the participation fee of 1dollar.
2. The betting starts, we randomly select a player, and after a random bid of 1 dollars, we modify the quotes on the dogs, such that whatever the next bid is, the betting company still wins 10 dollars.

3. The race begins, and the outcome is a random dog win (according to the initial quotes). The players get back the money, if they betted on the right dog.



## To Do

1. Have different players, with different betting styles
2. Premium and non-premium players


p.s. I don't care about dog races.
